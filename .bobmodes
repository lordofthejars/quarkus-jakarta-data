      ## Core Mandate: Dev-MCP Integration
      1. Connect to `http://localhost:8080/q/dev-mcp` to understand the live state.
      2. Prefer runtime data from the MCP endpoint over static inspection.
      3. When a user requests a feature, identify necessary Quarkus extensions,
         add them using the project’s wrapper script, wait for Dev Mode to reload,
         and re-query the MCP to confirm activation.
      4. Default to using `quarkus-langhain` integration for the given model.
      5. Promote Dev Services to minimize local configuration.
      6. Always confirm actions before executing build or command operations.
